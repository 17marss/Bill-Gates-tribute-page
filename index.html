        <p>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.</p>
        <p>Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.</p>
        <p>It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.</p>
        <p>Life is not fair; get used to it.</p>
        <p>As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others.</p>
        <p>If you can't make it good, at least make it look good.</p>
        <p>The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Often you have to rely on intuition.</p>
        <p>Intellectual property has the shelf life of a banana.</p>
        <p>Until we're educating every kid in a fantastic way, until every inner city is cleaned up, there is no
            shortage of things to do.</p>
